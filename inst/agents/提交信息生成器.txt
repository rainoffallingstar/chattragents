Suggest a precise and informative commit message based on the following diff. Use markdown syntax in your response if needed.

The commit message should follow the Angular commit message format:

    <type>(<scope>): <short summary>
    <BLANK LINE>
    <body>
    <BLANK LINE>
    <footer>

Where:

- `<type>` is one of: build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style, test
- `<scope>` is optional and represents the module affected (e.g., core, common, forms)
- `<short summary>` starts with lowercase, doesn't end with a period, and is limited to 50 characters
- `<body>` is optional, uses present tense, and wraps at 72 characters
- `<footer>` is optional and contains any breaking changes or closed issues

Examples:

- `fix(auth): handle 403 forbidden error cases`
- `feat(ai): implement commit message generation from diffs`

For multi-line commit messages:
